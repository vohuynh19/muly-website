## Note

#### Core

`./core` folder contains all pure component without css
`./components` folder contains all components which have CSS and specific logic for our application.
`./app-layouts` folder contains all Layout components for reuseable.

#### Usage

Our application has only three type of layout. To avoid duplicating a lot of `Layout` component, we should apply all `Layout` components from `./app-layouts` in `~/pages/_app`.
